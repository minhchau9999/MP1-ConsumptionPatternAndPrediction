⚡ Energy Data Analytics & Grid Optimization – Learning Roadmap
👋 Hi, I’m on a journey to become proficient in data analytics with a specialization in grid optimization for the energy sector. Here’s the roadmap I’ve followed — and what’s coming next.

🔹 Stage 1: Python & Data Foundations
Focus: Data wrangling, time-based analysis, and visualization

📊 Cleaned and explored time-series datasets using pandas & matplotlib

🧮 Built load profiles with hourly, daily, and seasonal breakdowns

✅ Delivered: Basic EDA and hourly load plots

🔹 Stage 2: Energy Data Visualization & Clustering
Focus: Understanding building behavior through data

📈 Built calendar heatmaps and weekday/weekend comparison plots

🧠 Applied K-Means clustering to segment buildings by load shape

🗂️ Compared load profiles (residential, office, parking garage)

✅ Delivered: Load heatmaps, PCA cluster visualization, insights into building usage patterns

🔹 Stage 3: Load Forecasting & Optimization
Focus: Predictive modeling and cost-aware decision making

🔮 Forecasted electricity demand using Prophet and XGBoost

📉 Evaluated models with RMSE, MAE, MAPE

💡 Optimized building load to minimize TOU energy costs

Manual load shifting (heuristics)

Linear programming (cvxpy) for optimal scheduling

✅ Delivered:

 Forecast vs actual plots

 Load scheduling optimization plots

 Cost savings summary

🚀 Stage 4: Grid-Aware Optimization & Intelligent Control
